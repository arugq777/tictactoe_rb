##About
This is Tic Tac Toe game, somewhat clumsily written in Ruby, after banging my head against a couple different attempts at writing a minimax algorithm.

To play, enter "ruby play_tictactoe.rb"

##To-Do
Refactor. Spiff up the layout of the web version more. Resizing on the web version is wonky, as well.
